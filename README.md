PixelMix by AudioPixel is a visual engine optimized for performance that generates, mixes, and maps OpenGL pixel shaders in 3D space.

Runs in the browser using WebGL and Three.js, and is easy to add to any web application.
The generated shaders can also be run (and cached) in any OpenGL environment (such as C++ / Java / IPhone / Android).

The original goal in creating PixelMix was to drive led lighting and video projection equipment. Capable of capturing and broadcasting color values of pixels at fast framerates, it can allow for communication to lighting equipment using Video, UDP, & DMX protocols. 

There are other advantages as well when compared to standard OpenGL pixel shaders, as shown in the comparison table below.

Shader editor: [github/examples/shader_edit.html](https://github.com/hepp/audiopixel3/blob/master/examples/shader_edit.html)

Load in additional WebGL shaders, such any of the ones found at [glslsandbox](http://glslsandbox.com/) or [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com).


## Features ##

* Animate pixel shaders seamlessly across textures and point cloud particles 
* Mix multiple pixel shaders together using various blend modes
* Map each shader to any number of areas using 3D transformations (can be used to pixel-map lights and projection surfaces)
* Capture color values for all 3D nodes at high framerate (can be used for broadcasting data to lighting equipment)
* Easily manipulate animations with incoming audio or data feeds
* Enhance your shaders with helper methods / values not normally in GLSL
* Multiple position / index maps can be used to generate content (spoof gl_FragCoords per shader)
* Import any GLSL fragment shader
* Preview channels in previz mode while still communicating main mix to hardware (coming soon)
* Rendering views: 3D point cloud, 3D directional lights (coming soon), 2D quad pixel shaders (coming soon)
* HTML5 video input (coming soon)

## Steps to using API ##

[View this in a simple example](https://github.com/hepp/audiopixel3/blob/master/examples/basic_example.html)

#### 1. Include pixelmix.js and three.js ####

```
<script src="pixelmix.min.js"></script>
<script src="three.min.js"></script>

scene = new THREE.Scene();
renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer(); 

ap.init(scene, renderer);
ap.setSize(glWidth, glHeight);

```
#### 2. Add Nodes ####

Import nodes with several auto generating methods included to draw simple grids at various sizes.
It's also easy to import new node positions via JSON.

```
// Add a simple grid of Nodes 
ap.hardware.addSimpleNodeGrid(x, y, z, width, height, pitch);
ap.updateNodePoints();

```
#### 3. Add Shaders ####

```
<!-- Include source -->
<script src="import/shaders/SolidColor.js"></script>

// Add the Shader to Channel 1 (default fit to all nodes)
ap.simpleSetup({channel: 1, ids: ["SolidColor"]});

```
#### 4. Change uniforms (Optional UI Layer) ####

Easily alter shaders while running, and assign params, mix and blend values to controllers. 
Here we are setting values on the shader we just created.

```
// Set param 1 on the clip to .7
ap.set("p1", .7, 1, 1, 1); // Addressing Data: Channel 1, Pod 1, Clip 1

// Set mix on the clip to be .9
ap.set("mix", .9, 1, 1, 1); // Addressing Data: Channel 1, Pod 1, Clip 1

```

## Possible Uses Include ##

* Mixer for displaying pixel shaders into 3D space
* Control light shows via laptop or mobile device
* Music and data visualizers
* Animate particles / sprites in any OpenGL or Three.js project
* Runs on dedicated server / gaming machine, triggered by MIDI or OSC API
* Lighting conceptualize / architectural tool

## Terminology ##

A Clip is simply a Shader with additional timing, scaling, and input controls. 
Loading a Shader into a Clip allows us to play it back several times, at multiple sizes and animation speeds.

A Pod is a way to group and mix Clips to be blended and positioned as one. Pods can then be blended into other Pods. Pods can also be represented many times over in many places. An example of this could be to take one Clip/Shader and display it in two different places, perhaps with the second instance mirrored or scaled. 

Once a Shader has been loaded into a Clip, it can be positioned in multiple places with a Pod, and then mixed into the main mix inside a Channel.




**Node**: A single light unit or RGB pixel. Usually represented as a particle on screen, but can be represented in many ways.

**Port**: A group of Nodes. May also contain protocol and address data.

**Shader**: A opengl glsl fragment shader that runs directly on the gpu.

**Clip**: A clip is a shader harnessed in a playable form. Clips can play shaders back at different speeds and different positions.

**Clipfx**: A type of clip that does not blend, instead it analyses incoming values and outputs a new one.

**Pod**: A group of clips that are to be positioned together, combined, and blended as one.

**Position-unit**: Defined coordinates that a pod can choose to populate into. Pod's can render to any number of position units to allow advanced mapping.

**Channel**: Main source of color and values (like dmx) to be assigned to nodes. Channels hold pods, which may also hold clips.

**Postfx**: A type of channel that takes the entire main mix and routes it through a set of clipfxs.

**Previz**: Render a to-be-displayed channel to preview on screen, while still outputting the main channel mix unaffected.
