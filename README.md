PixelMixer by AudioPixel is a visual engine optimized for performance that can generate, blend, and map OpenGL pixel shaders in 3D space.

Runs in the browser using HTML5 WebGL and [Three.js](http://threejs.org), and is easy to add to any web application.
The generated shaders can also be used in any OpenGL ES 2.0 environment (C / Java / IPhone / Android).

The original goal in creating PixelMixer was to drive lighting and video projection equipment. It is capable of capturing all color / data values of 3D pixels at fast framerates, which can be used for communication to physical lighting equipment using protocols such as Video, DMX, UDP, & Rest.

## Steps to using API ##

[View this in a simple example](https://github.com/hepp/audiopixel3/blob/master/examples/basic_example.html)

[View all examples](https://github.com/hepp/audiopixel3/blob/master/examples/)

[How to run things locally](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally)


#### 1. Setup Pixelmixer.js and Three.js ####

```
<!-- Include scripts -->
<script src="pixelmixer.min.js"></script>
<script src="three.min.js"></script>

// Setup Three.js
scene = new THREE.Scene();
renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer(); 

// Setup PixelMixer.js
PX.init(scene, renderer);
PX.setSize(glWidth, glHeight);

```
#### 2. Add Nodes ####

Import nodes with several auto generating methods included to draw simple grids at various sizes.
It's also easy to import new node positions via JSON.

```
// Add a simple grid of Nodes 
PX.hardware.addSimpleNodeGrid(x, y, z, width, height, pitch);
PX.updateNodePoints();

```
#### 3. Add Shaders ####

```
<!-- Include source -->
<script src="import/shaders/SolidColor.js"></script>

// Add the Shader to Channel 1 (default fit to all nodes)
PX.simpleSetup({channel: 1, ids: ["SolidColor"]});

```
#### 4. Change values at runtime (Optional UI Layers) ####

Easily alter shaders while running, and assign params, mix and blend values to controllers. 
Here we are setting values on the shader we just created.

```
// Set param 1 on the clip to .7
PX.set("p1", .7, 1, 1, 1); // Addressing Data: Channel 1, Pod 1, Clip 1

// Set mix on the clip to be .9
PX.set("mix", .9, 1, 1, 1); // Addressing Data: Channel 1, Pod 1, Clip 1

```

Each instance of a loaded shader has independent uniforms setup for easy control. Global values are also provided to all shaders that are ready to be populated with audio or any sort of data feed you provide. Easily enhance any loaded shaders to respond to the incoming values, and/or setup UI layers to control and change them directly.

## vs Vanilla GLSL Shader ##
Shaders loaded into the API extend GLSL to achieve additional functionality:

| Feature | API | GLSL |
|----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| GPU accelerated | x | x |
| GPU optimized Math methods | x | x |
| X,Y coordinates | x | x |
| Attributes and uniforms | x | x |
| Z coordinate | x | |
| Index value | x | |
| Multiple coordinates per pixel | x | |
| Last color value per pixel | x | |
| Last color values for all pixels | x | |
| Color blending algorithms | x | |
| Random values | x | |
| Accompanying init & update methods | x | |
| Hardware port / light unit info | x | |

## Terminology ##

A Clip is simply a Shader with additional timing, scaling, and input controls. 
Loading a Shader into a Clip allows us to play it back several times, at multiple sizes and animation speeds.

A Pod is a way to group and mix Clips to be blended and positioned as one. Pods can then be blended into other Pods. Pods can also be represented many times over in many places. A simple example would be to take one Pod and display it in two different places, perhaps with the second instance mirrored or scaled. 

Once a Shader has been loaded into a Clip, it can be positioned in multiple places with a Pod, and then mixed into the main mix with a Channel.




**Node**: A single light unit or RGB pixel. Usually represented as a particle on screen, but can be represented in many ways.

**Port**: A group of Nodes. May also contain protocol and address data.

**Shader**: A opengl glsl fragment shader that runs directly on the gpu.

**Clip**: A clip is a shader harnessed in a playable form. Clips can play shaders back at different speeds and different positions.

**Clipfx**: A type of clip that does not blend, instead it analyses incoming values and outputs a new one.

**Pod**: A group of clips that are to be positioned together, combined, and blended as one.

**Position-unit**: Defined coordinates that a pod can choose to populate into. Pod's can render to any number of position units to allow advanced mapping.

**Channel**: Main source of color and values (like dmx) to be assigned to nodes. Channels hold pods, which may also hold clips.

**Postfx**: A type of channel that takes the entire main mix and routes it through a set of clipfxs.

**Previz**: Render a to-be-displayed channel to preview on screen, while still outputting the main channel mix unaffected.

## About us ##

![AudioPixel Logo](https://github.com/hepp/audiopixel3/blob/master/docs/audiopixel-web-grid.png)


AudioPixel develops custom lighting technology and sound-reactive visual programming.

For 5+ years we have built our own lighting projects, helped artists create large scale interactive installations, programmed nightclub lighting systems, toured with musicians, designed stages with custom lightshows for multi-day festivals, and lit up Burning Man art cars and sound camps. Currently we are on the third revision of refining our in-house lighting software package.

In our quest for optimizing AudioPixel's live programming techniques, PixelMixer was born.

Our aim was to develop a platform we could use for any installation or stage design we could dream up.

Now we are releasing it to the world in the hopes that it might benefit interactive light for all.
